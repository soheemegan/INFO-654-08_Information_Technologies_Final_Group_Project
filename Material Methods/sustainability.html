    <h1>Systems of Fashion: Code, Fibre, and Consequence</h1>
    <p>
      This page looks at sustainability not as a slogan but as a system:
      the servers that recommend a dress to you, the trucks that move it, the
      fibres that touch your skin, and the routes those fibres take when
      you’re finished with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fashion is estimated to be responsible for a significant share of global
      greenhouse gas emissions and mounting textile waste. Instead of a list of
      “dos and don’ts”, this page traces how digital tools accelerate trends,
      how materials carry hidden water and carbon histories, and how brands are
      experimenting with circular design.

  <!-- CHAPTER 1: DIGITAL COST -->
  <section>
    <div class="chapter-label">chapter one</div>
    <h2>The Invisible Digital Cost of Clothing</h2>

    <div class="two-column">
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          When people talk about “sustainable fashion”, most of the images we
          see are analog: cotton fields, dye houses, cutting tables. But
          between you and almost any garment sits a dense digital layer —
          recommendation engines, image servers, content-delivery networks and
          analytics dashboards that decide what appears on your screen.
        </p>

        <p>Every time you open a shopping app, a few things happen at once:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>High-resolution product photos and videos are streamed from servers.</li>
          <li>Algorithms update which items to show you next based on your behaviour.</li>
          <li>Analytics tools log clicks, scroll depth, wishlists and returns.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          All of that computation runs in data centres that draw electricity
          from power grids that are not always renewable. Luxury groups like
          Kering and LVMH now include this digital footprint in their climate
          strategies, setting science-based targets and shifting offices,
          boutiques and parts of their digital infrastructure to renewable
          energy. At the same time, the growth of e-commerce has increased
          packaging waste and single-use plastics — from polybags to the
          estimated tens of billions of plastic hangers used each year worldwide.
        </p>

        <div class="pull-quote">
          A garment now carries two stories: one woven from cotton or polyester,
          and one woven from code and infrastructure.
        </div>

        <p>
          This chapter is a reminder that the “online” part of online shopping
          is not weightless. Any serious attempt to decarbonise fashion has to
          include choices about hosting, content design, image compression and
          how many times a product photo needs to follow us around the internet.

    <h2>Algorithmic Acceleration: Why Trends Shrink in Time</h2>

    <div class="two-column">
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          Fashion once moved in seasons. Designers showed collections twice a
          year; buyers placed orders; clothes filtered into stores. Now,
          trend cycles can be measured in weeks or even days. Platforms read
          what we click on, pause on and share, and use that information to
          push similar images to millions of people at once.
        </p>
        <p>In simplified form, the loop looks like this:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A silhouette or colour spikes in engagement on social platforms.</li>
          <li>Algorithms amplify it to more users who behave similarly.</li>
          <li>Suppliers receive signals and rush out lookalike versions.</li>
          <li>E-commerce sites highlight “trending” pieces, reinforcing demand.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Consultancy analyses suggest that if nothing changes, fashion’s
          emissions could rise sharply by 2030. At the same time, other
          research shows that most brands could reduce their greenhouse gas
          emissions by more than half for a cost of around one to two percent
          of revenue by focusing on energy-efficient production, cleaner
          materials and better planning.

          Some brands are testing the slower model: seasonless collections,
          investment in traceable fibres, or digital passports that show where
          materials came from. Others still chase the metrics of pure volume.
          The same data that drives overproduction could also be used to plan
          fewer, better-made items — but only if the goal shifts from
          “sell as much as possible” to “sell enough, for longer”.

    <h2>Too Many Trends: Human Costs of the Infinite Wardrobe</h2>

    <div class="two-column">
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          An accelerated trend cycle isn’t only an environmental issue; it
          reshapes how people feel in their own clothes. Interviews with Gen Z
          shoppers describe a constant sense of being “behind” — that by the
          time they save up for a look they like, the feed has already moved on.
        </p>
        <p>Common themes include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A feeling that style is a test you are always about to fail.</li>
          <li>Pressure to buy pieces that photograph well even if they don’t last.</li>
          <li>Confusion about what counts as “good taste” when everything cycles so fast.</li>
          <li>Exhaustion from trying to track micro-trends across multiple platforms.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          At the production end, workers experience a different form of tempo:
          shorter lead times, last-minute order changes, and expectations that
          factories will absorb the risks of overstock or cancellations.
          Sustainability here is not just about emissions and water, but the
          pace at which human beings are asked to design, sew, ship and perform.

      One response to this burnout has been a renewed interest in personal
      uniform dressing, thrifting and repeating outfits on purpose. These
      aren’t only aesthetic decisions; they are small refusals of a system
      that treats identity as something that expires on a monthly basis.

    <h2>Your Wardrobe as a Watershed</h2>

    <div class="two-column">
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          If the digital system decides what we want, the material system is
          what it takes to make it real. Life-cycle assessments of clothing
          highlight a few especially intense stages: growing and processing
          fibres, dyeing and finishing fabrics, and energy use in mills and
          factories. These are also the stages where brands have the biggest
          opportunity to cut emissions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thinking of your wardrobe as a small watershed can be helpful. Each
          garment has drawn on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Water for irrigation, processing and repeated home washing.</li>
          <li>Land for fibre crops or grazing animals.</li>
          <li>Fossil fuels for synthetics, transport and heating.</li>

          <li>
            <strong>Viscose / rayon</strong>: Made from wood pulp; historically
            linked to deforestation and toxic processing, though some producers
            now use certified forests and closed-loop chemical systems.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lyocell (e.g. TENCEL)</strong>: A newer cellulosic fibre
            typically produced with more carefully managed solvents.
          </li>

          smaller labels that work with deadstock fabrics, artisan weavers and
          natural dyes. The wardrobe becomes the place where all of these

          Circular fashion asks a simple question with complicated answers:
          instead of treating clothes as linear “take-make-discard” objects,
          how do we keep materials in use for as long as possible?
        </p>
        <p>
          Luxury and mainstream brands are experimenting with different

            has long refused fur and exotic skins.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Gucci</strong> and other Kering brands test collections
            made with recycled polyester, organic cotton and bio-based
            materials, supported by clearer impact reporting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Burberry</strong> donates surplus fabrics to design schools
            and runs capsule lines using recycled fibres, pairing heritage
            patterns with new material flows.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Chanel</strong> has launched a recycling platform focused
            on turning its own production waste into high-quality materials for

        <div class="glossary-term">SKU explosion</div>
        <div class="glossary-definition">
          “SKU” stands for stock-keeping unit, a unique code for each product.
          When brands offer many variations of colour, cut, length and fit, the
          number of SKUs can grow dramatically. This “explosion” makes
          forecasting harder and can increase waste when items do not sell,
          because each micro-variation is produced in smaller, riskier amounts.

      <div class="glossary-item">
        <div class="glossary-term">Data labelling for style</div>
        <div class="glossary-definition">
          The process of tagging garments or images with labels such as
          “oversized blazer”, “mid-rise”, or “floral print.” These labels help
          algorithms recognise patterns in style and power search filters,
          recommendations and automated trend analysis. Behind every neat filter
          in an app lies a mix of human and machine labour deciding what counts
          as which style.

      <div class="glossary-item">
        <div class="glossary-term">Digital twin (supply chain)</div>
        <div class="glossary-definition">
          A digital twin is a virtual model of a real-world system. In fashion,
          a digital twin of a supply chain might show how materials move from
          farms to mills, factories, warehouses and stores, allowing companies
          to test changes virtually before making them. Used well, digital
          twins can make it easier to test circular or lower-impact scenarios
          before committing to real-world changes.

      <div class="glossary-item">
        <div class="glossary-term">Embodied energy of computing</div>
        <div class="glossary-definition">
          The total energy required to build, run and cool digital hardware.
          When we shop online, this embodied energy forms part of the impact,
          even though it is rarely counted in traditional fashion sustainability
          metrics. It includes the servers that host product images, the
          networks that move data and the devices in our hands.

      <div class="glossary-item">
        <div class="glossary-term">Circular design loops</div>
        <div class="glossary-definition">
          Design strategies that plan from the start for reuse, repair, resale
          and recycling. Instead of a straight line from production to landfill,
          circular loops aim to keep garments circulating through different
          forms of use for as long as possible. In a truly circular system,
          digital records and physical design work together so that materials
          can be recovered and re-used rather than lost.
