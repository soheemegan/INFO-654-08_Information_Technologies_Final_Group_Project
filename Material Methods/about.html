	<h1>About Us</h1>

	<p>Phoenix Smith is a Kansas Citian by way of Nashville, TN, pursuing her two master’s degrees in Art & Design History and Library & Information Science with an advanced certificate in Archives. With a background in Sociology and Communications, she is passionate about human pleasure and expression as communicative connectors. Fashion is one of global society’s standard mediums for human expression, in fact, it’s my favorite way to express myself. I value innovative, human centered thinking, which sparks my curiosity about transforming all of human practices to human centered reform. In fashion’s case, this looks like sustainability.</p>


	<p>Anastasia Branas is a born-and-raised Philadelphian, getting their MSLIS with an advanced certificate in Archives. They had childhood fashion designer dreams, which is now honed in the occasional sewing project and apparently making fashion-themed HTML pages. They enjoy layering in winter, red accents, playing with texture, and a general sense of androgyny.</p>


	<p>Megan Kim was born in Seoul and raised between Boston and New York City. She is currently pursuing an M.S. in Data Analytics and Visualization at Pratt Institute’s School of Information. Her love for fashion started early, through Vogue spreads, styling Barbies, and experimenting with makeup, and it now fits naturally into her broader interest in how design, technology, and culture intersect. For this project, she’s especially focused on how digital platforms and app ecosystems shape modern shopping experiences through data, UX design, and technological infrastructure. She enjoys exploring how digital systems influence consumer behavior — and she’s currently deep in a Phoebe Philo–era Celine mood.</p>

	<p>Uttara Parekh is originally from India, where her father’s generational jewelry business and the country’s textile traditions shaped her early appreciation for craftsmanship and expressive design. A trained Architect and Art Curator, now studying Data Analytics and Visualization at Pratt Institute, she works where sustainability, data, and technology intersect using analytics and interface design to reveal environmental impact, understand consumer patterns, and build more transparent, responsible digital systems. In this project, she expands that focus by developing interactive features, API-driven components, and data-informed content that examine sustainability in modern fashion experiences. Her fashion interests blend contemporary design with traditional craft, balancing elegance with quirk and a love for experimentation.
