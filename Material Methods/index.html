	<h1>Hello and Welcome to Our Information Technologies Final Project Website!</h1>

	<b1>We are students at Pratt Institute in the School of Information.</b1>

	<b1> Across all of our different disciplines within Information Science, we are all interested in the intersection of fashion and technology. As Gen Z young adults, our lives have been saturated by the internet and its influence. We grew up with iPhones and social media, having been fed a narrative of quicker and quicker information for all our adolescence. Within the intensity of the internet itself, lies the pressures of growing up online as a woman. We are raised with inevitable expectations of how to act and how to present ourselves, with the internet intensifying this to a new level.</b1>

	<h2>Inquiries</h2>
	
	<b1>How can we be conscious of these influences and still enjoy ourselves?</b1>
	
	<b1>Fashion serves as a middle-ground where these contradictions meet. There is joy in the everyday, and joy in agency of one’s appearance. Clothing and expression has long been influenced by one’s environment and by capitalism. As the culture of 
	<a href=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/07/style/gen-z-trend-cycle.html>advertisements</a>
	changes and intensifies, we ask ourselves how we can cope with it all. It is overwhelming to have grown up with hateful magazines and early Instagram expectations of fashion and body standards, only for it to continue to intensify as we have entered early adulthood.</b1>

	<b1>As students and scholars, we understand the impact and politics behind any decision, even something as seemingly minute as the clothing we wear on our bodies. As the culture in the U.S. and beyond gets more conservative and self-conscious, what does that mean for our 
	<a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/20/style/ultra-thin-models.html>clothing?</a>
	Young girls continue to be dress-coded and ridiculed because of societal clothing and body standards, just as we did when we were younger, and just as our mothers did.</b1>

was dress-coded for wearing a swim suit under her shirt. Gustafson spoke at the Dickinson County Board of Commissioners meeting stating, “Once you start banning one thing, where does it stop? Clothes don’t talk, people do. If what I am wearing doesn’t hurt anyone why should it matter? When I speak you should listen to my words, not my wardrobe.”

	<h2>What now?</h2>

	<b1>In between the vapid nature of trend cycles and fast fashion, lies a very real and very impactful political influence on the collective culture. Through this website, we will investigate the environmental, economic, and political aspects of fashion and its accompanying technology. From the impact of sustainable fashion, the impact of contemporary online fashion apps, and the history of the online shopping experience, we hope to convey a new perspective on the intersection of fashion and technology in the 21st century.
</b1>

	<b1>Through this site we will investigate various aspects of the worlds of fashion and technology. Exploring histories and strategies of e-commerce, sustainability, and consumerism, we hope to shed light on the technological and environmental backgrounds of the fashion industry.</b1>
